# 2048 - About my fork

I really like the game and I made its 7826's fork. My changes are really small but I think that when you get closer to 2048, tiles must became greaner, not to be only yellow after reaching 128. Also I added HighScores list for my grandmother to be easy for her to compete her scores with mine.

Here is a screenshot with my preferences for the game and of course it's online and you can play it [here](http://valkirilov.github.io/2048/). And of course I should be thankfull to [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli) who entertain the world with his work.

That screenshot is fake, by the way. I never reached 2048 :smile:
